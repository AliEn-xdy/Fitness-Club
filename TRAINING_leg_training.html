<h2>Standing Forward Bend</h2>

<p><h4>How to do it:</h4> Stand with your feet hip-width apart. Lean forward at the hips with your knees slightly bent. Lay your chest on your upper thighs and let your head fall forward towards the floor. Engage your quads and keep your hips centered over your feet. Slowly work your muscles until your legs have straightened without locking your knees. Hold the position for 8 – 10 deep breaths.<br></p>
<h2>Hack Squat</h2>

<p><h4>How to do it:</h4> Once you’ve got the hack squat machine set up, step into the machine and place your shoulders and back against the pads with your feet planted flat and firm on the plate. Keep them together to really target your quads. Engage your core, release the safety, and begin to lower yourself down until your thighs are parallel to the platform. Hold for a second, and then drive your heels into the platform to propel yourself back up to the starting position.<br>

Your knees should not lock at the top, and you want to keep them steady and avoid them splaying outward or inward while you are doing your squats. Do six to eight reps and at least three sets, taking up to a 60 second break in between if needed. Once you add more weight, lower the reps down to four to six until you can work your way back up to complete the sets.</p>
<h2>Leg Extensions</h2>
<img src="C:\Users\vigneshwar yadav\Desktop\Fitness Club\lt\l3.jpg"height="370px "width=450px"><br>
<p><h4>How to do it:</h4> Get the machine ready with your starting weight and make sure the pads in front are adjusted so that the pad is right above your foot and your leg is at a 90° angle. Hold onto the side bars for leverage and make sure the rest of your body is stationary so you only engage the quads to lift the weight. Exhale as you pull the weights up and pause for a second before you inhale and bring the weights back down. Complete 10 – 12 reps and a total of three sets. Rest up to 30-60 seconds in between sets if needed.
Variation: You can vary your foot position depending on the side of the thigh you want to work. Point your toes out if you want to work the inner abductor muscles, point your toes in for the outer abductor muscles. You can also challenge yourself by doing one leg at a time to really get your quads burning.
