<h1>Bust out these exercises for a bigger, better, stronger chest.</h1><br>
<h2>Dumbbell Pullover</h2>
<img src="C:\Users\vigneshwar yadav\Desktop\Fitness Club\ct\c1.jpg"height="200px" width="370px">
<p>Some people would contend this exercise doesn’t belong on a top-10 list for chest. They’ll either swear up and down that it trains the back, or they’ll belittle it as a relic once revered but now relegated to the training scrap heap because of its potential danger to the shoulders. <br>

The first group is right — it doubles as a fine back exercise. But for those who claim shoulder-impingement concerns, well, we’d instead argue that the problem isn’t the pullover; it’s the lack of flexibility prevalent in today’s gyms. If you don’t have full mobility in your upper back and delts, the pullover simply won’t feel comfortable. You need to work on that, and start doing this staple that served some of the best bodybuilders of all time, from Frank Zane to Arnold Schwarzenegger to Dorian Yates. 

<h4>Main Areas Targeted:</h4> pectorals, latissimus dorsi, serratus<br>

<h4>Strengths:</h4> Most chest exercises fall into one of two categories: They involve pressing a weight (bending and extending at the elbows) or doing a flye motion (keeping your elbows fixed and closing and opening your arms in front of your body). The pullover is one of a scant few options that work the chest at a completely different angle, in a top-to-bottom contraction. <br>

<h4>How-To:</h4> Lie on a bench with your upper back, head and neck supported and your feet flat on the floor. Hold a dumbbell with your arms extended above your face. Maintaining just a slight bend in your elbow throughout, slowly lower the dumbbell backward, allowing your elbows to come to a point at which they align with your ears. When you’ve stretched as far as you can without bending your elbows, flex through your chest and lats to reverse direction to bring the dumbbell back overhead.<br></p>
<h2>Push-Up</h2>
<img src="C:\Users\vigneshwar yadav\Desktop\Fitness Club\ct\c2.jfif"height="300px"width=400px"><br>
<p>Your drill instructor was a son of a you-know-what, but he was on to something when he screamed, “Drop and give me 20!” The quintessential bodyweight exercise is nearly perfect in its simplicity. “The push-up is a great standard exercise because it requires one piece of equipment — you,” says fitness expert Levi Harrison, M.D., orthopedic surgeon and author of The Art of Fitness: A Journey to Self-Enhancement. “This exercise targets the triceps, pectoralis major, deltoids — especially the anterior portion — and the serratus anterior. When properly done, the push-up also can engage your core muscles effectively.”

<h4>Main Area Targeted:</h4> pectorals (Note that you can change the emphasis depending on your angle: With feet and hands on the floor, you’ll take aim at the midpecs; elevating your feet on a bench focuses on the upper pecs; and putting your hands on a bench with your feet on the floor hits the lower pecs.)<br>

<h4>Strengths:</h4> Ever try to pack a set of dumbbells and a bench in a suitcase? (Don’t laugh. Many a gym rat about to go on a trip has contemplated it.) Thing is, most exercise equipment is hard to lug around. Weights are heavy — by design, of course. The answer to staying fit on the road is, in part, using your own body as resistance. Push-ups can be done in hotel rooms, parks, prison cells ... anywhere you have solid ground to work with.<br>

<h4>How-To:</h4> In a plank position, place your feet together, toes on the floor, with your hands wider than shoulder width and flat on the floor and your elbows extended. Keeping your head neutral and abs tight, lower yourself by bending your elbows until your chest gently touches the ground, then press through your palms until your arms are straight once again.<br></p>
<h2>Pec-Deck Flye</h2>
<img src="C:\Users\vigneshwar yadav\Desktop\Fitness Club\ct\c3.jfif"height="370px "width=300px"><br>
<p>First, a clarification: When we say “pec-deck flye,” we are referring specifically to the version in which you bend your arms 90 degrees and put your elbows on pads. The other variant — in which you hold handles and your elbows roam free, which we refer to as a “machine flye” in this magazine — is certainly a fine exercise, but in our opinion, not quite on the same level. Why? The pec-deck places better focus on the all-important squeeze when you bring your arms in front of your body, causing the muscle fibers at the center of your breastplate to spring to full attention.

<h4>Main Area Targeted:</h4> middle pecs<br>

<h4>Strengths:</h4> When performed correctly, with arms in constant contact with the pads — a mental trick is to think of leading with your elbows — the pec-deck pits your pectorals directly against resistance while offering a broad range of motion and a reduced risk of injury when compared with free weights.<br>

<h4>How-To:</h4> Sit with your lower back fully in contact with the pad and your feet flat on the floor. With your elbows at 90-degree angles and forearms flush against the pads, move your arms slightly forward to disengage the weight from the stack. From here, deliberately flex your pecs to bring the handles out in an arc until they meet in front of your body. Squeeze hard, then slowly return to the start, stopping when your upper arms are even with your torso, and repeat.<br></p>
<h2>Decline Bench Press</h2>
<img src="C:\Users\vigneshwar yadav\Desktop\Fitness Club\ct\c4.jfif"height="200px" width="370px">
<p>
No self-respecting bodybuilder or exercise physiologist would dare suggest the decline bench press is equal to its two more celebrated siblings, the incline and flat bench press. But that doesn’t make it a black sheep. It still targets the pectorals, although the focus is on the lower-pec area rather than the more prominent and more aesthetically critical upper and middle regions.

<h4>Main Area Targeted:</h4> lower pecs<br>

<h4>Strengths:</h4> Although the lower pecs are targeted to an appreciable degree by flat bench presses, the decline is a direct way to chip away at them. It’s not all that necessary for beginners, but if you’re fine-tuning a developed physique, it’s undeniably helpful.<br>

<h4>How-To:</h4> Lie on a decline bench. Your torso should be fully supported from your head to your hips, with your knees bent and feet harnessed behind roller pads. Grasp the bar with a wide, overhand grip. Bend your arms and slowly lower the bar toward your lower chest. When the bar reaches chest level, forcefully extend your arms, elevating the bar back to the starting position.<br></p>
